### Hi there üëã

My name is Khalid Abuhakmeh ([@buhakmeh][twitter] on Twitter). These days I'm a developer advocate at [JetBrains][jetbrains] primarily focusing on [.NET][dotnet] technologies using tools like [Rider][rider] and [ReSharper][resharper]. I also create content for JetBrains at the [official blog][jb_blog].

I'm also proud of my personal blog at [khalidabuhakmeh.com][blog], where I write mostly about .NET. My posts focus on learning in the open and try to help readers solve problems or grasp ideas. I'm on a tech journey and I hope you come along with me on the ride.

Some of my favorite posts include:

- [Conditionally Apply LINQ Clauses](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/conditionally-apply-linq-clauses)
- [Use Neo4J to Find The Shortest Path](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/use-neo4j-to-find-the-shortest-path)
- [Writing .NET Database Integration Tests](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/dotnet-database-integration-tests)
- [SQL Polling Listener for Azure SQL and Other SQL Databases](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/sql-polling-listener-for-azure-sql-and-other-sql-databases)

### Office Hours

As a developer advocate, I'm here to help by offering [Office Hours](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/office-hours/). These are anywhere from 30-60 minute sessions where we can discuss tech, problem solving, or general career advice. I've held every position from junior developer to director of software development.

### OSS

I also [do OSS](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/khalidabuhakmeh) when the time allows. Some of my most popular NuGet packages include:

- [ConsoleTables](https://github.com/khalidabuhakmeh/consoletables)
- [Codez](https://github.com/khalidabuhakmeh/codez)

That's over **1.2 Million downloads!**

I have also contributed logos to multiple .NET ecosystem projects like [Marten](https://github.com/JasperFx/marten), [DDay.iCal](https://github.com/rianjs/ical.net), and [Buildalyzer](https://github.com/daveaglick/Buildalyzer).
